  This is a cluster morphology for deploying an UPGRADE to
  git.baserock.org. It doesn't work for the initial deployment. The
  deployer MUST have ssh access to root@git.baserock.org. To use:

      morph deploy --upgrade trove.baserock.org-upgrade gbo.VERSION_LABEL=2014-05-29

  Replace the value of gbo.VERSION_LABEL above with the current date.
  You can add letters if you need to upgrade multiple times in a day.
